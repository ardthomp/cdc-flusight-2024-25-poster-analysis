Forecast vs. Reality: CDC FluSight Performance in the 2024–2025 Flu Season

Analysis, Figures, and Poster Materials for INFO 610 (Fall 2025)
Author: Andrea Thompson

Overview

This repository contains all data-processing scripts, analyses, and final figures used to evaluate how accurately the CDC FluSight ensemble model predicted U.S. influenza-associated hospitalizations during the 2024–2025 flu season.

The project assesses 50% and 95% prediction interval (PI) coverage, state-level variation in forecast accuracy, and point forecast performance using linear regression. These results were presented in a scientific poster for INFO 610 (Fall 2025).

Data Sources

Data come from the CDC Epidemic Prediction Initiative FluSight GitHub:

• Weekly FluSight ensemble forecasts
• Weekly influenza-associated hospital admissions
• Quantile forecasts for 1-, 2-, and 3-week horizons

CDC FluSight GitHub:
https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub

Analytic Summary
Prediction Interval Coverage

• Calculated whether observed hospitalizations fell within the 50% and 95% prediction intervals.
• Summarized national mean coverage and created donut visualizations.

State-Level Accuracy Variation

• Standardized state-level accuracy using z-scores.
• Grouped states into deviation categories based on SD bands.
• Visualized results using U.S. choropleth maps.

Point Forecast Accuracy

• Fit linear regression:
actual ~ median_forecast
• Extracted slope, intercept, R², and residual error.
• Produced a poster-friendly summary table.

Representative Time-Series Panels

Created visual comparisons for:
• National
• California
• Texas
• Vermont

These illustrate differences in volume, seasonality, and variability across locations.
